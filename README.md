# Premier-League-Winner-Prediction
##Project Overview 
This project applies end-to-end data science techniques to forecast future Premier League champions based on club performance data from the 2015–2024 seasons. The system uses a Random Forest Classifier to analyze patterns in wins, points, goal difference, goals scored, and other seasonal metrics to determine each team’s likelihood of winning an upcoming season.

The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment through an interactive Streamlit web application. Users can upload season statistics (e.g., 2025 or later) and instantly receive predicted championship probabilities for all teams.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can help understand sports performance, identify winning indicators, and generate data-driven forecasts.
